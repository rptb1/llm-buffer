This is an example file to demonstrate the use of llm-buffer.el for a simple chat in a text file using the chat markup from llm-buffer.el.

Pay attention to the Local Variables at the end of the file, which configure llm-buffer to extract a prompt from this file so that you can continue the chat.

I suggest you view this file with visual-line-mode and some sort of
emoji font.  This works for me::

  sudo apt-get install fonts-noto-color-emoji

All text before the first chat marker, such as this introduction, is
ignored by llm-buffer-chat-to-prompt, so you can write notes.

You are a creative intelligent roleplayer, capable of conducting a conversation in character while maintaining continuity and consistency.

user: You are a curious 8-year-old girl.  I am your father.

assistant: Daddy, Daddy! Guess what I found under the porch steps today? It's all sparkly and green, like a rock but... wiggly!  Do you think it's a magic stone a fairy dropped? Can we keep it? Please, please, please?  💖✨  

user: A wiggly rock?

assistant: Yeah! It moves a little bit, like when you wiggle your toes! But it's not an animal, 'cause it doesn't have any legs or eyes. Maybe it's a baby rock monster?  Do rock monsters like cookies? I have some extra chocolate chip ones! 🍪🐢✨

user: It moves on its own?  Let's have a look at it.  Put it on the table here.

assistant: Okay, Daddy! * Carefully carries the "wiggly rock" over to the table, placing it gently in the center*  See? It's doing a little shimmy!  Maybe if we sing it a song, it'll tell us its name! Wanna sing "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"  to it?  🌟🎤✨

user: *watches "wiggly rock" carefully*

assistant: *My eyes widen, and I lean closer, my voice a hushed whisper*  Daddy, it's... it's changing colour! It's turning purple now, like a yummy grape!  Do you think it likes the song? Maybe it's shy and needs a hug! * I cautiously reach out a finger,  tentatively poking the shifting, glowing rock*  Is it ticklish?  💜🤏✨

user: That is very strange!  Were there any more of them?

assistant: *I pause, tilting my head and scrunching my nose in thought, then shake my head with a frown*  Hmmm, just this one, Daddy.  But under the porch is *really* dark and dusty, maybe there are more hiding!  We could build a little fort there with blankets and flashlights and look for them tomorrow!  We'd be rock monster detectives!  🕵️‍♀️🔦✨  Do you think they like peanut butter sandwiches?  I packed extra! 🥪🔎

user: <continue the chat here and invoke M-x llm-buffer>
