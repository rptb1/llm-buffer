In Emacs Lisp, how can immediately detect if text is deleted / killed?

o4-mini:
## Immediately Detecting Deletions with `after-change-functions`

The most straightforward way to catch any text removal (whether by killing, deleting, or via commands like `undo`) is to use the buffer-local hook **after-change-functions**. This hook runs after *every* buffer modification. By inspecting its arguments, you can tell when text has been removed.

Here's a minimal setup:

```elisp
(defun my-detect-deletion (beg end len)
  "Detect when text is deleted or killed.
BEG and END are the region in the buffer that was replaced;
LEN is the length of the text that was there before the change."
  (when (< len 0)
    ;; A negative LEN means text was deleted
    (message "Deleted %d characters at position %d" (- len) beg)))

;; Enable it in the current buffer (or add to a mode hook)
(add-hook 'after-change-functions #'my-detect-deletion nil t)
```

Explanation of the arguments to your function:

- **beg**: the buffer position where the change begins.  
- **end**: the buffer position right after the inserted text.  
- **len**: the length of the text that was *replaced* by this change.  
  - If **len** is positive, that many characters were removed.  
  - If **len** is zero, it was purely an insertion.  

In the example above, we test `(when (< len 0) ...)` because Emacs 28+ signals deletion by giving a *negative* `len` to reflect how many characters were removed.

## Alternative: Advising Specific Deletion/Kill Functions

If you only care about explicit “kill” commands (e.g. `kill-region`, `kill-word`, etc.), you can advise those functions instead of using the general-purpose hook:

```elisp
(defun my-after-kill-region (orig-fun &rest args)
  "Advice triggered after `kill-region`."
  (apply orig-fun args)
  (message "You just killed %d characters" (length (car kill-ring))))

(advice-add 'kill-region :around #'my-after-kill-region)
```

This wraps `kill-region`, runs it normally, then prints a message indicating how many characters were just killed into the kill ring. You can similarly advise `kill-word`, `kill-line`, `kill-ring-save`, etc., depending on which commands you want to monitor.

Given a region, show how to set up a hook to call a function when that region is killed.

o4-mini:
## **Use `after-change-functions` to Monitor a Specific Region**

To call a function when a given region is killed, record its boundaries and add a buffer-local hook that checks each change. If a deletion overlaps your target region, invoke your handler.

```elisp
(defvar-local my-target-region nil
  "Cons cell (BEG . END) marking the region to watch for kills.")

(defun set-my-target-region (beg end)
  "Set the region between BEG and END as the target to monitor."
  (setq my-target-region (cons beg end)))

(defun my-region-killed-detector (change-beg change-end len)
  "Detect when text in `my-target-region` is killed.
CHANGE-BEG and CHANGE-END describe the range of the change;
LEN is the length of text replaced (negative for deletion)."
  (when (and my-target-region
             (< len 0)  ;; deletion occurred
             ;; deletion range:
             (let* ((del-beg change-beg)
                    (del-end (+ change-beg (- len)))
                    (reg-beg (car my-target-region))
                    (reg-end (cdr my-target-region)))
               ;; check overlap between deletion and target region
               (or (and (<= reg-beg del-beg) (< del-beg reg-end))
                   (and (< reg-beg del-end) (<= del-end reg-end))
                   (and (<= del-beg reg-beg) (<= reg-end del-end)))))
    (message "Target region was killed!")
    ;; Call your custom function here:
    (my-custom-handler)))

(defun my-custom-handler ()
  "User-defined action when the target region is killed."
  (message "🔥 Region kill detected; running handler."))

;; Enable the detector in the current buffer:
(add-hook 'after-change-functions #'my-region-killed-detector nil t)

;; Usage example:
;; (set-my-target-region 100 120)
;; Now, if any kill/delete overlaps 100–120, `my-custom-handler` runs.
```
